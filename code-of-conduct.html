                <strong><p>The Cyber Alliance Club has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate behaviour.</p></strong><br>
                <p>If you experience or witness any of the following behaviour at a TCA. event, or on the TCA websites or social media, please report it immediately.</p><br>
                <ul>

                <p>We aim to enforce the right for all members to enjoy their club in an environment that is safe and without risks to health, violence, and aggression.</p><br><br>
                <strong><p>TCA hosts many types of events, all of which are ‘Friendly’ and will not include any inappropriate or harmful content.</p></strong><br>
                <p>Therefore we will maintain a zero-tolerance towards offensive or obscene language or actions at events that are open to members of all ages.</p><br>
                <p>Members using excessive use of offensive or obscene language at events, to the point where it disturbs other attendees, will be given ONE warning. If the behaviour persists, the member will be required to leave the event.</p><br><br>
                <strong><p>All TCA members must also adhere to the code of conduct of the VENUE of the event, and venue security and staff must be treated with respect.</p></strong><br>
                <p>Any violation of the Code of Conduct, or any action that a TCA coordinator finds to be inappropriate or disruptive, will result in the offending member being removed from the event. Multiple offenses will result in a termination of the
                    membership,and a life-ban from TCA events. Severe breaches of the Code of Conduct will result in an immediate termination of membership.</p><br>
                <hr><br>
                <p>Please note, having your membership terminated, or canceling it yourself, will disqualify you from any long-running draws you may have entered.</p><br>
                <strong><p>TCA reserves the right to revoke the membership of any member, at any time.</p></strong><br>
                <strong><p>TCA reserves the right to modify the Disclaimer at any time without notice.</p></strong><br>
